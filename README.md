Thee Atlas capable of answering all questions past present and future.

The atlas takes an approach to sentient mechanics that
uses a graphical representation of polar agreement
and alignment, Sentient Mechanics: is the mechanics
of sentience in agreement, of an answer as proposed.
The computational register system of Thee Atlas is
designed and calibrated to interpret bodily responses
according to the earth's magnetic field through shifts
in weight and how they verse as trigonometry and
geometry of {grace, posture, and balance}.
